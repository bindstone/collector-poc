== PURPOSE

*This* is a small POC to import a JIRA Database with the https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.atlassian.jira/jira-rest-java-client-core/4.0.0[Jira rest client] in https://neo4j.com/[Neo4j]. The application is based on https://spring.io/[Spring.io] and https://github.com/Wolfgang-Schuetzelhofer/jcypher[JCypher]

The application loads the 50 first records from a Jira service in the poc https://issues.jboss.org[] from the project = CLOUD.
