= COLLECTOR

== Intro
People ask me, why I am so fascinated from Neo4j. The first contact, I made with Neo4j was in Oslo on the https://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=32b4dabd[JavaZone]. Since than I follow the growing of the technology year by year. Neo4j is still a https://db-engines.com/en/ranking/graph+dbms[leading Graph Database]. But why I am so fascinated? I created this small POC, perhaps you find it out in trying the https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher-query-language[Cypher language].

== Purpose

*This* is a small POC to import a JIRA Database with the https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.atlassian.jira/jira-rest-java-client-core/4.0.0[Jira rest client] in https://neo4j.com/[Neo4j]. The application is based on https://spring.io/[Spring.io] and https://github.com/Wolfgang-Schuetzelhofer/jcypher[JCypher].

The application loads the 50 first records from a Jira service in the poc https://issues.jboss.org[] from the project = CLOUD.

== Instructions
* *Requirement:* A https://neo4j.com/download[Neo4j Database]
* *Download:* git clone https://github.com/bindstone/collector-poc.git
* *Install:* mvn clean install
* *Configuration:* configure the file: application.properties
* *Run:* mvn spring-boot:run
